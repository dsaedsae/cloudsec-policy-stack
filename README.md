**Defense-in-depth, as code, on a free local cluster.** One request to one service
passes through three independent policy layers — network (L3/L4), HTTP (L7), and
application authorization — each enforced and verified live, with a shift-left gate in CI.

```
   a single request:  web ──▶ api ──▶ (resource)
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Terraform │ kind cluster + Cilium (CNI), as code                  │ IaC
   Identity  │ RBAC + label↔SA admission + SPIFFE mutual auth (B7)    │ who is web/api
   Cilium L3 │ default-deny in+out; only web→api→db; egress locked    │ no exfil
   Cilium L7 │ only GET/POST on /accounts/* reach api (Envoy)         │ path/method
   Cedar     │ api PDP authorizes every call: owner? limit? role?     │ authz-as-code
   Tetragon  │ eBPF runtime: SIGKILLs a shell spawned in the db pod   │ detect+prevent
   Data      │ WireGuard in-transit + Secret encryption at-rest       │ protect the data
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   checkov   │ shift-left scan of Terraform + K8s (CI gate, 0 fail)   │ + gitleaks
```

## What it demonstrates

- **IaC (Terraform)** — the cluster *and* its CNI are declarative/reproducible; `terraform validate` clean in CI.
- **Zero-trust network (Cilium / eBPF)** — default-deny on **both ingress and egress**; least-privilege hops
  only. The `web→api` rule is **L7** (Envoy): only the account API is reachable; other paths are dropped at
  the edge. Egress is locked to next-hop + DNS, so a **compromised pod cannot reach the internet, cloud
  metadata, or the API server** (proven live).
- **Authorization as code (Cedar), enforced inline** — the `api` is a small PDP service that calls Cedar on
  **every request** (owner check, transfer limit via request context, `forbid` on frozen accounts, role
  hierarchy). Same policies are unit-tested (`cedar/authz.py`, 8/8) and portable to **Amazon Verified Permissions**.
- **Runtime detection + prevention (Tetragon / eBPF)** — network and authz act before/at the request; nothing
  watches a workload once it's popped. A `TracingPolicy` **SIGKILLs any shell exec in the db tier in-kernel**
  (legit processes unaffected, pod stays healthy), and Tetragon records every process exec. Hubble adds
  flow visibility (`hubble observe -n shop --verdict DROPPED`).
- **Shift-left CI gate** — GitHub Actions runs Cedar tests + checkov + `terraform validate` + gitleaks on
  every push, and a kind job that stands up the stack and re-runs the live enforcement proof (incl. runtime).
- **Hardened workloads** — non-root, no priv-esc, all caps dropped, read-only rootfs, seccomp, probes,
  limits, `restricted` Pod Security. checkov exceptions are documented in `.checkov.yaml` — triage, not theater.

## The defense-in-depth proof (verified live + in CI)

One asset (`api`), every layer. `scripts/verify.{sh,ps1}` runs all of these (21/21 PASS):

| Layer | Test | Result | Enforced by |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| L1 network | web → db (no allowed hop) | **000** | Cilium L3 drop |
| L2 HTTP | web → api `GET /auditlogs/*` | **403** | Cilium L7 (path not allowed) |
| L3 authz | `alice` → `GET /accounts/acct-alice` | **200** | Cedar allow (owner) |
| L3 authz | `bob` → `GET /accounts/acct-alice` | **403** | **Cedar deny (not owner)** |
| L3 authz | `alice` transfer 500 (≤ limit) | **200** | Cedar allow |
| L3 authz | `alice` transfer 5000 (> limit) | **403** | Cedar deny (limit) |
| L3 authz | `alice` transfer from frozen acct | **403** | Cedar `forbid` |
| L3 authz | `alice` transfer **-100** (negative) | **403** | Cedar positive-amount guard |
| L3 input | malformed `X-User` header | **400** | PDP validates before Cedar |
| L1 network | api → db (allowed hop) | **200** | Cilium allow |
| egress | web → `https://example.com` | **000** | Cilium egress default-deny |
| egress | web → cloud metadata `169.254.169.254` | **000** | egress default-deny (no SSRF→metadata) |
| egress | web → kube-apiserver `10.96.0.1:443` | **000** | egress default-deny |
| L4 runtime | shell exec inside `db` pod | **SIGKILL (137)** | Tetragon `TracingPolicy` (eBPF) |
| identity | `api-sa` create-pods / read-secrets | **no** | least-privilege RBAC (no RoleBinding) |
| identity | `app:api` on `web-sa` (mismatch) | **admission DENY** | `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` (label↔SA) |
| identity | `app:api`+`api-sa` by authorized op | **admitted** | label↔SA satisfied + SA-use gate allows operators |
| identity | `shop:deployers` runs workload as `api-sa` | **admission DENY** | SA-use gate (`request.userInfo`) |
| identity | authorized operator deploys `api-sa` workload | **admitted** | SA-use gate allows named operators |
| identity | CI SA schedules CronJob as `api-sa` | **admission DENY** | SA-use gate (jobTemplate path) |
| data-in-transit | pod-to-pod traffic | **WireGuard** | Cilium transparent encryption |

That's **21/21** in `scripts/verify.{sh,ps1}`. The two 403s are a highlight: `GET /auditlogs` (blocked at L7
before reaching the app, body `Access denied` from Envoy) vs `bob`'s account read (reaches the app, body
`Cedar denied: ...`) — **same network path, same L7-allowed route, different principal**. The identity rows
are the other highlight: the same `api-sa` workload is **admitted for an authorized operator but denied for
the limited `shop:deployers` principal** — identity use is bound to the requester, not open to anyone who can
deploy.

Two further controls are demonstrated by their own scripts (not in the always-on suite, since both alter the
cluster substrate):
- **Mutual auth (SPIFFE)** — `kubectl apply -f k8s/netpol-mutual.yaml` upgrades the `web→api` edge to
  `authentication.mode: required`; the request still returns **200** because the SVID handshake completes
  (SPIRE issues each workload an identity from its ServiceAccount). Demonstrated **manually** (Lab 4, opt-in) —
  **CONFIGURED**, not asserted in the always-on `verify` suite (coverage ID4; see `docs/mls-coverage.csv`).
- **Secret encryption-at-rest** — `scripts/enable-secrets-encryption.*` turns on AES-CBC in etcd and proves it
  by reading the raw datastore: the stored Secret begins `k8s:enc:aescbc:v1:` with **no plaintext**. Verified live.

## Layout

```
terraform/   kind + Cilium + Tetragon (helm)     app/api/    FastAPI Cedar PDP (the api image)
cedar/       schema + policies + 8 unit tests    k8s/        app, netpol, tracingpolicy, probes
scripts/     up / verify / scan / down (.ps1+.sh) .github/   CI workflow + kind config
```

## Quickstart

Prereqs: Docker, `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `cilium`, `terraform`, Python 3.12.

```bash
python -m venv .venv && ./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

./.venv/bin/python cedar/authz.py     # authz unit tests, no cluster needed -> 8/8
bash scripts/up.sh    || pwsh scripts/up.ps1       # provision kind+Cilium, build api, deploy
bash scripts/verify.sh|| pwsh scripts/verify.ps1   # prove all 3 layers live (table above)
bash scripts/down.sh  || pwsh scripts/down.ps1     # tear down
```

(Windows: `.venv\Scripts\python`, and the `.ps1` scripts. CI runs the `bash` path on Linux.)

## Learn it

New here? Follow the **[guided labs](docs/)** — Lab 0 needs only Python (5 min):
authz-as-code → shift-left scanning → network+authz on a cluster → eBPF runtime →
identity (B7) → data protection. Each lab shows the payoff, then has you *break and
fix* one layer. **Why it matters** (금융 망분리 완화/MLS): see
[`docs/financial-mls-mapping.md`](docs/financial-mls-mapping.md). **Run it in
production-shape:** [`runbooks/`](runbooks/) — incident response, key rotation,
break-glass, tier onboarding, deploy/rollback, AWS teardown. **Cloud + cost:**
[`docs/aws-eks-path.md`](docs/aws-eks-path.md).

## Validation status

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push: Cedar tests, checkov, `terraform validate`/`fmt`, gitleaks,
  and a kind integration job that brings up the stack and runs `scripts/verify.sh`.
- `cedar/authz.py` — schema validates, **8/8** scenarios pass (incl. negative-amount deny).
- `checkov` (Terraform + K8s) — **K8s 452 passed / 0 failed / 5 documented skips**, Terraform clean. Scope:
  checkov validates the *workloads + Terraform*; the CiliumNetworkPolicy (a CRD it can't see) and Cedar are
  covered by the live `verify` job and `cedar/authz.py`. Images are digest-pinned (`@sha256`) except the
  locally-built api image, which carries one *scoped* (not global) skip — see `.checkov.yaml` / `k8s/app.yaml`.
- Live enforcement — **21/21** checks in the table above pass on kind+Cilium+Tetragon (locally and in CI),
  on a pinned `kindest/node:v1.34.0` (k8s ≥1.30 so the identity admission policy installs). Mutual auth
  Secret encryption-at-rest is verified by its own script (`enable-secrets-encryption`);
  mutual auth (SPIFFE) is applied opt-in (`k8s/netpol-mutual.yaml`) and verified live manually
  (Lab 4 / Identity), not in the default `verify` suite.

## Roadmap

The core (IaC + zero-trust net incl. egress + inline Cedar authz + Tetragon runtime + CI) is in.

Done since:
- ✅ **Identity hardening (B7)** — threat model of label-as-identity (`THREAT_MODEL.md`); least-privilege per-tier ServiceAccounts; a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` binding the `app` label to its SA; a **SA-use gate** (`k8s/admission-sa-use.yaml`) that lets only authorized operators run a workload under a tier identity (so the limited `shop:deployers` role can deploy but not impersonate a tier); and Cilium **mutual auth / SPIFFE** on the `web→api` edge (`k8s/netpol-mutual.yaml`). The first three links — who may deploy → label/SA consistency → who may use a tier SA — are **live-verified** in the always-on suite; the final SVID/SPIFFE link (ID4) is applied **opt-in and verified manually** (CONFIGURED, not in the always-on suite — see `docs/mls-coverage.csv`).
- ✅ **Supply chain (scan + SBOM)** — public images pinned by `@sha256` digest (the local api image carries a scoped, documented exception); the scan gate (`scripts/scan.*`) now runs a **trivy image vuln+secret gate + CycloneDX SBOM**. It caught `CVE-2025-62727` (HIGH, Starlette DoS) on the first run; remediated by bumping `app/api/requirements.txt` (starlette `0.41.3→1.3.1`) and re-verifying — gate green. Image **signing** (cosign/SLSA) is still open (documented on the ECR path — the local image has no registry; `docs/aws-eks-path.md` §1-1).
- ✅ **Authorization depth (ABAC + ReBAC + agent delegation)** — beyond the inline Cedar ABAC PDP: an **AI-agent delegation** model (`cedar/agent/`, `python cedar/agent_authz.py`, 12/12) enforcing, for *non-owned* data, the *intersection* of agent-ceiling ∧ delegating-user clearance (confused-deputy prevention), plus an owner-override path capped by the agent ceiling for the user's own records — the tests are *falsifiable* (deleting the intersection or owner-override policy flips a load-bearing Allow to Deny). And a **ReBAC** relationship demo (`rebac/`, `fga model test` 11/11 + a live OpenFGA `/check` path) filling the gap `docs/authorization-model.md` §4 names. See `docs/nhi.md` for the NHI lifecycle framing.
- ✅ **Data protection** — WireGuard pod-to-pod encryption (in transit) + Secret encryption-at-rest in etcd (`scripts/enable-secrets-encryption.*`); the three data states mapped to controls in `docs/06-data-protection.md`.
- ✅ **Learning labs** — numbered `docs/` walkthroughs (0–5), each break-and-fix.

Next:
- **Image signing** — `cosign sign`/`verify` + SLSA attestation on the **ECR path** (released cosign needs a registry; the local kind image has none — `docs/aws-eks-path.md` §1-1). Scan + SBOM already shipped (above).
- **SA-use gate — cluster-wide generalization** — the always-on gate is the `shop`-scoped `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` (Pods/Deployments/RS/STS/DS/Jobs **and CronJobs**, live-verified). A *generated, cluster-wide* form is **provided as an opt-in capstone** — a Kyverno `ClusterPolicy` (`k8s/kyverno-sa-use.yaml`) + `scripts/enable-kyverno.*` / `verify-kyverno.*` proving the gate in a second namespace. It was **not stood up in the last session (RAM)**, so the cross-namespace row (ID7) stays NOT_COVERED until proven live — honest, not claimed. Note: like the VAP, Kyverno gates the workload controller, not the controller-spawned Pod (same A2 residual).
- ✅ **WireGuard packet capture (opt-in evidence)** — `scripts/capture-wg.*` captures on the db node's host netns, driven by real api→db traffic: 40 WireGuard packets (UDP/51871, the original run's `-c 40` capture ceiling) cross the wire and **0 plaintext** bytes appear on `eth0`. The dispositive evidence is WG-packet presence + cross-node placement; plaintext-absence is corroborating (cross-node pod traffic is encapsulated). The current script adds a traffic-flow gate + removes the cap (re-run on a live cluster to regenerate). Upgrades ET2 to VERIFIED (gated/evidence, not a baseline check).

## Notes

Local `kind` cluster — no cloud cost. Cedar policies port to **Amazon Verified Permissions**; Cilium policies
to any Cilium cluster (EKS/GKE/AKS). Identity (`X-User`) is **unauthenticated demo input** (charset-validated
to prevent injection); a real system derives the principal from a verified JWT `sub`. Entities are static
fixtures baked into the image. Learning/portfolio artifact, not turnkey prod. Licensed under [MIT](LICENSE).
